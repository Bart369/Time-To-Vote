# Time-To-Vote

<b>User Story:</b>

Joe is tired of what's going on in this crazy world so he decides to check out the Time To Vote app. 

He enters his address and sees all his elected officials. He also signed up to receive a notification/email for upcoming elections in his state. 

Knowing who his elected officials are, he can go do some research on them while he waits to get his notification to go vote!

<b>Tech:</b>

Frontend: React <br>
Backend: Node/Express <br>
API - Google Civic Information Api (https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api) <br>

Features/Improvements: I would like to allow the user to share the election dates and even the elected officials data on facebook. I want to be able to show information on the candidates running but this data is not yet available. I think this app would work
best on mobile so I need to do some tweeking to improve its functionality on those platforms.
